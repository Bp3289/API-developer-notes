# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

## Mashape

This API has a lot of great api's to choose from along with great documentation. The only problem is that Mashape uses the unirest library for the requests, which we haven't covered yet. Besides the unirest issue, Mashape is a great place to find an api. 

Mashape's documentation comes along with examples for each request which is nice. Also Mashape provides the endpoints to test in PostMan which is very helpful.
