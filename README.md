# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

by alex:
highly recommend this api, great instructions online and lots of room for expansion and personalization. just takes a second to get used to their 'specific' commands, in this sense reading the documentation is essential otherwise you might be banging your head against the wall like "WHY CAN'T I GET THE LATITUDE WHEN I'M SAYIN .LAT", because it's not quite as simple as that. Like I said, highly recommend. 10/10 would use again.
